<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>Akka Cluster provides a fault-tolerant decentralized peer-to-peer based cluster
<a class="reference internal" href="#membership">membership</a> service with no single point of failure or single point of bottleneck.
It does this using <a class="reference internal" href="#gossip">gossip</a> protocols and an automatic <a class="reference internal" href="#failure-detector">failure detector</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="terms">
<h2>Terms</h2>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><strong>node</strong></dt>
<dd>A logical member of a cluster. There could be multiple nodes on a physical
machine. Defined by a <cite>hostname:port:uid</cite> tuple.</dd>
<dt><strong>cluster</strong></dt>
<dd>A set of nodes joined together through the <a class="reference internal" href="#membership">membership</a> service.</dd>
<dt><strong>leader</strong></dt>
<dd>A single node in the cluster that acts as the leader. Managing cluster convergence
and membership state transitions.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="membership">
<h2>Membership</h2>
<p>A cluster is made up of a set of member nodes. The identifier for each node is a
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">hostname:port:uid</span></tt> tuple. An Akka application can be distributed over a cluster with
each node hosting some part of the application. Cluster membership and the actors running
on that node of the application are decoupled. A node could be a member of a
cluster without hosting any actors. Joining a cluster is initiated
by issuing a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Join</span></tt> command to one of the nodes in the cluster to join.</p>
<p>The node identifier internally also contains a UID that uniquely identifies this
actor system instance at that <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">hostname:port</span></tt>. Akka uses the UID to be able to
reliably trigger remote death watch. This means that the same actor system can never
join a cluster again once it's been removed from that cluster. To re-join an actor
system with the same <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">hostname:port</span></tt> to a cluster you have to stop the actor system
and start a new one with the same <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">hostname:port</span></tt> which will then receive a different
UID.</p>
<p>The cluster membership state is a specialized <a class="reference external" href="http://hal.upmc.fr/docs/00/55/55/88/PDF/techreport.pdf">CRDT</a>, which means that it has a monotonic
merge function. When concurrent changes occur on different nodes the updates can always be
merged and converge to the same end result.</p>
<div class="section" id="gossip">
<h3>Gossip</h3>
<p>The cluster membership used in Akka is based on Amazon's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/files/amazon-dynamo-sosp2007.pdf">Dynamo</a> system and
particularly the approach taken in Basho's' <a class="reference external" href="http://basho.com/technology/architecture/">Riak</a> distributed database.
Cluster membership is communicated using a <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gossip_protocol">Gossip Protocol</a>, where the current
state of the cluster is gossiped randomly through the cluster, with preference to
members that have not seen the latest version.</p>
<div class="section" id="vector-clocks">
<h4>Vector Clocks</h4>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_clock">Vector clocks</a> are a type of data structure and algorithm for generating a partial
ordering of events in a distributed system and detecting causality violations.</p>
<p>We use vector clocks to reconcile and merge differences in cluster state
during gossiping. A vector clock is a set of (node, counter) pairs. Each update
to the cluster state has an accompanying update to the vector clock.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="gossip-convergence">
<h4>Gossip Convergence</h4>
<p>Information about the cluster converges locally at a node at certain points in time.
This is when a node can prove that the cluster state he is observing has been observed
by all other nodes in the cluster. Convergence is implemented by passing a set of nodes
that have seen current state version during gossip. This information is referred to as the
seen set in the gossip overview. When all nodes are included in the seen set there is
convergence.</p>
<p>Gossip convergence cannot occur while any nodes are <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">unreachable</span></tt>. The nodes need
to become <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">reachable</span></tt> again, or moved to the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">down</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">removed</span></tt> states
(see the <a class="reference internal" href="#membership-lifecycle">Membership Lifecycle</a> section below). This only blocks the leader
from performing its cluster membership management and does not influence the application
running on top of the cluster. For example this means that during a network partition
it is not possible to add more nodes to the cluster. The nodes can join, but they
will not be moved to the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">up</span></tt> state until the partition has healed or the unreachable
nodes have been downed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="failure-detector">
<h4>Failure Detector</h4>
<p>The failure detector is responsible for trying to detect if a node is
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">unreachable</span></tt> from the rest of the cluster. For this we are using an
implementation of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.jaist.ac.jp/~defago/files/pdf/IS_RR_2004_010.pdf">The Phi Accrual Failure Detector</a> by Hayashibara et al.</p>
<p>An accrual failure detector decouple monitoring and interpretation. That makes
them applicable to a wider area of scenarios and more adequate to build generic
failure detection services. The idea is that it is keeping a history of failure
statistics, calculated from heartbeats received from other nodes, and is
trying to do educated guesses by taking multiple factors, and how they
accumulate over time, into account in order to come up with a better guess if a
specific node is up or down. Rather than just answering &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; to the
question &quot;is the node down?&quot; it returns a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">phi</span></tt> value representing the
likelihood that the node is down.</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">threshold</span></tt> that is the basis for the calculation is configurable by the
user. A low <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">threshold</span></tt> is prone to generate many wrong suspicions but ensures
a quick detection in the event of a real crash. Conversely, a high <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">threshold</span></tt>
generates fewer mistakes but needs more time to detect actual crashes. The
default <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">threshold</span></tt> is 8 and is appropriate for most situations. However in
cloud environments, such as Amazon EC2, the value could be increased to 12 in
order to account for network issues that sometimes occur on such platforms.</p>
<p>In a cluster each node is monitored by a few (default maximum 5) other nodes, and when
any of these detects the node as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">unreachable</span></tt> that information will spread to
the rest of the cluster through the gossip. In other words, only one node needs to
mark a node <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">unreachable</span></tt> to have the rest of the cluster mark that node <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">unreachable</span></tt>.</p>
<p>The nodes to monitor are picked out of neighbors in a hashed ordered node ring.
This is to increase the likelihood to monitor across racks and data centers, but the order
is the same on all nodes, which ensures full coverage.</p>
<p>Heartbeats are sent out every second and every heartbeat is performed in a request/reply
handshake with the replies used as input to the failure detector.</p>
<p>The failure detector will also detect if the node becomes <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">reachable</span></tt> again. When
all nodes that monitored the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">unreachable</span></tt> node detects it as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">reachable</span></tt> again
the cluster, after gossip dissemination, will consider it as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">reachable</span></tt>.</p>
<p>If system messages cannot be delivered to a node it will be quarantined and then it
cannot come back from <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">unreachable</span></tt>. This can happen if the there are too many
unacknowledged system messages (e.g. watch, Terminated, remote actor deployment,
failures of actors supervised by remote parent). Then the node needs to be moved
to the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">down</span></tt> or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">removed</span></tt> states (see the <a class="reference internal" href="#membership-lifecycle">Membership Lifecycle</a> section below)
and the actor system must be restarted before it can join the cluster again.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="leader">
<h4>Leader</h4>
<p>After gossip convergence a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">leader</span></tt> for the cluster can be determined. There is no
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">leader</span></tt> election process, the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">leader</span></tt> can always be recognised deterministically
by any node whenever there is gossip convergence. The leader is just a role, any node
can be the leader and it can change between convergence rounds.
The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">leader</span></tt> is simply the first node in sorted order that is able to take the leadership role,
where the preferred member states for a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">leader</span></tt> are <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">up</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">leaving</span></tt>
(see the <a class="reference internal" href="#membership-lifecycle">Membership Lifecycle</a> section below for more  information about member states).</p>
<p>The role of the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">leader</span></tt> is to shift members in and out of the cluster, changing
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">joining</span></tt> members to the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">up</span></tt> state or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">exiting</span></tt> members to the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">removed</span></tt>
state. Currently <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">leader</span></tt> actions are only triggered by receiving a new cluster
state with gossip convergence.</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">leader</span></tt> also has the power, if configured so, to &quot;auto-down&quot; a node that
according to the <a class="reference internal" href="#failure-detector">Failure Detector</a> is considered <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">unreachable</span></tt>. This means setting
the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">unreachable</span></tt> node status to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">down</span></tt> automatically after a configured time
of unreachability.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="seed-nodes">
<h4>Seed Nodes</h4>
<p>The seed nodes are configured contact points for new nodes joining the cluster.
When a new node is started it sends a message to all seed nodes and then sends
a join command to the seed node that answers first.</p>
<p>The seed nodes configuration value does not have any influence on the running
cluster itself, it is only relevant for new nodes joining the cluster as it
helps them to find contact points to send the join command to; a new member
can send this command to any current member of the cluster, not only to the seed nodes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id2">
<h4>Gossip Protocol</h4>
<p>A variation of <em>push-pull gossip</em> is used to reduce the amount of gossip
information sent around the cluster. In push-pull gossip a digest is sent
representing current versions but not actual values; the recipient of the gossip
can then send back any values for which it has newer versions and also request
values for which it has outdated versions. Akka uses a single shared state with
a vector clock for versioning, so the variant of push-pull gossip used in Akka
makes use of this version to only push the actual state as needed.</p>
<p>Periodically, the default is every 1 second, each node chooses another random
node to initiate a round of gossip with. If less than ½ of the nodes resides in the
seen set (have seen the new state) then the cluster gossips 3 times instead of once
every second. This adjusted gossip interval is a way to speed up the convergence process
in the early dissemination phase after a state change.</p>
<p>The choice of node to gossip with is random but it is biased to towards nodes that
might not have seen the current state version. During each round of gossip exchange when
no convergence it uses a probability of 0.8 (configurable) to gossip to a node not
part of the seen set, i.e. that probably has an older version of the state. Otherwise
gossip to any random live node.</p>
<p>This biased selection is a way to speed up the convergence process in the late dissemination
phase after a state change.</p>
<p>For clusters larger than 400 nodes (configurable, and suggested by empirical evidence)
the 0.8 probability is gradually reduced to avoid overwhelming single stragglers with
too many concurrent gossip requests. The gossip receiver also has a mechanism to
protect itself from too many simultaneous gossip messages by dropping messages that
have been enqueued in the mailbox for too long time.</p>
<p>While the cluster is in a converged state the gossiper only sends a small gossip status message containing the gossip
version to the chosen node. As soon as there is a change to the cluster (meaning non-convergence)
then it goes back to biased gossip again.</p>
<p>The recipient of the gossip state or the gossip status can use the gossip version
(vector clock) to determine whether:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>it has a newer version of the gossip state, in which case it sends that back
to the gossiper</li>
<li>it has an outdated version of the state, in which case the recipient requests
the current state from the gossiper by sending back its version of the gossip state</li>
<li>it has conflicting gossip versions, in which case the different versions are merged
and sent back</li>
</ol>
<p>If the recipient and the gossip have the same version then the gossip state is
not sent or requested.</p>
<p>The periodic nature of the gossip has a nice batching effect of state changes,
e.g. joining several nodes quickly after each other to one node will result in only
one state change to be spread to other members in the cluster.</p>
<p>The gossip messages are serialized with <a class="reference external" href="https://code.google.com/p/protobuf/">protobuf</a> and also gzipped to reduce payload
size.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="membership-lifecycle">
<h3>Membership Lifecycle</h3>
<p>A node begins in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">joining</span></tt> state. Once all nodes have seen that the new
node is joining (through gossip convergence) the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">leader</span></tt> will set the member
state to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">up</span></tt>.</p>
<p>If a node is leaving the cluster in a safe, expected manner then it switches to
the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">leaving</span></tt> state. Once the leader sees the convergence on the node in the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">leaving</span></tt> state, the leader will then move it to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">exiting</span></tt>.  Once all nodes
have seen the exiting state (convergence) the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">leader</span></tt> will remove the node
from the cluster, marking it as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">removed</span></tt>.</p>
<p>If a node is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">unreachable</span></tt> then gossip convergence is not possible and therefore
any <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">leader</span></tt> actions are also not possible (for instance, allowing a node to
become a part of the cluster). To be able to move forward the state of the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">unreachable</span></tt> nodes must be changed. It must become <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">reachable</span></tt> again or marked
as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">down</span></tt>. If the node is to join the cluster again the actor system must be
restarted and go through the joining process again. The cluster can, through the
leader, also <em>auto-down</em> a node after a configured time of unreachability. If new
incarnation of unreachable node tries to rejoin the cluster old incarnation will be
marked as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">down</span></tt> and new incarnation can rejoin the cluster without manual intervention.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">If you have <em>auto-down</em> enabled and the failure detector triggers, you
can over time end up with a lot of single node clusters if you don't put
measures in place to shut down nodes that have become <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">unreachable</span></tt>. This
follows from the fact that the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">unreachable</span></tt> node will likely see the rest of
the cluster as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">unreachable</span></tt>, become its own leader and form its own cluster.</p>
</div>
<p>As mentioned before, if a node is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">unreachable</span></tt> then gossip convergence is not
possible and therefore any <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">leader</span></tt> actions are also not possible. By enabling
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">akka.cluster.allow-weakly-up-members</span></tt> it is possible to let new joining nodes be
promoted while convergence is not yet reached. These <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Joining</span></tt> nodes will be
promoted as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">WeaklyUp</span></tt>. Once gossip convergence is reached, the leader will move
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">WeaklyUp</span></tt> members to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Up</span></tt>.</p>
<p>Note that members on the other side of a network partition have no knowledge about
the existence of the new members. You should for example not count <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">WeaklyUp</span></tt>
members in quorum decisions.</p>
